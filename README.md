# SDAIA Academy Training Impact Sustainability Analysis Project

## Nywtk Hackathon – Data Analysis Track

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Nywtk Hackathon, Data Analysis Track. It aims to analyze the sustainability of company success by measuring real impact and distinguishing between value-driven success and success resulting only from quantitative expansion.

The analysis was practically applied to SDAIA Academy data as a case study.

## The Problem

Many training organizations achieve wide reach and notable recognition, but this reach raises important questions:

* Is this success based on real impact?
* Or is it the result of temporary expansion in programs and participants?
* How can sustainable success be ensured without operational inflation or ineffective budget increases?

## Objective

The project aims to:

* Analyze budget and training activity data
* Measure program efficiency using data-driven indicators
* Support decision-making based on real impact, not just scale

## Data Used

The analysis relied on two main datasets:

### 1️- Budget Data

* Years: 2021 – 2025
* Includes:

  * Spending items
  * Original and revised allocation
  * Expenditure and spending ratio

### 2️- Training Activity Data

* Years: 2024 – 2025
* Includes:

  * Activity name and type
  * Target audience
  * Number of graduates
  * Quarter and year

> Data is used for analytical purposes within the hackathon.

## Analysis Methodology

Data was analyzed to extract indicators that measure the real impact of training programs, including:

**Training Impact Efficiency Index**
This indicator helps to:

* Evaluate program efficiency
* Compare performance over time
* Support decisions on expansion or redesign

## Innovation

The innovation lies in transforming performance indicators from display tools into operational decision-support mechanisms, enabling training organizations to:

* Maintain sustainability
* Improve program quality
* Maximize impact without increasing budgets

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib

* **Google Colab**

* **Power BI**
  To create interactive dashboards and visually present results

## Deliverables

* Analysis of training program efficiency
* Measurement of impact progression over time
* Interactive dashboards
* Data-driven recommendations

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that the success of training organizations is not measured only by the number of programs or participants but by the extent of the impact achieved and their ability to sustain it through data-driven decisions.

This project is presented for educational and analytical purposes as part of the Nywtk Hackathon.
